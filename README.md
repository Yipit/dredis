# DRedis: Disk-based Redis implementation

Redis is a great key-value database and it's extremely fast because it's in-memory.
Some people want Redis's rich data types without having to worry about the memory limitations. For those
that can afford slower performance and want unlimited storage, DRedis may be an alternative.

**WARNING: This project is still experimental and it doesn't implement all Redis commands!**


## Running


```bash
$ make redis_server
```

All the current options are configured through environment variables:
* DREDIS_HOST (defaults to 127.0.0.1)
* DREDIS_PORT (defaults to 6377)
* ROOT_DIR (will create temporary directory if nothing is specified)
* DEBUG (defaults to false)
* FLUSHALL_ON_STARTUP (defaults to false)

\* `COMMAND`'s reply is incompatible at the moment, it returns a flat array with command names (their arity, flags, positions, or step count are not returned). 


## How is DRedis implemented

DRedis is created on top of the filesystem and relies on hierarchy (directories and files).
There's a *root directory* to store all keys. Every database is a directory inside of the root directory.
Every key is a directory inside of the database directory. Every key has a `type` file containing its type name (e.g., string, set, hash, zset).

Each supported key type has its own directory structure:
* `String` keys have a `value` file and its content is the value of the key
* `Set` keys have a `values` directory and each member of the set has a corresponding file (the content is the member value)
* `Hash` keys have a `fields` directory and each field has a corresponding file (the content is the field value)
* `Sorted set` key have a `scores` directory and a `values` directory.
Each file in `scores` represents a score and its content contains all values of that score.
Each file in `values` represents a value and its content is its score (constant time to access the score).

After running `SET msg "Hello World"` the root directory will look like this:

```
$ tree /path/to/root-dir
├── 0
│   └── msg
│       ├── type
│       └── value
├── 1
├── 10
├── 11
├── 12
├── 13
├── 14
├── 2
├── 3
├── 4
├── 5
├── 6
├── 7
├── 8
└── 9

```

## Lua support

Lua is supported through the [lupa](https://github.com/scoder/lupa) library.


## Challenges

### Data Consistency

Some commands may have to write to multiple files and if the disk fails in-between those writes, there may be consistency issues.
This project relies on the filesystem implementation (retry logic, etc). No hard-drive stress tests were performed. 

### Cluster mode & Replication

Replication, key distribution, and cluster mode isn't supported.
If you want higher availability you can create multiple servers that share or replicates a disk (consistency may suffer when replicating).
Use DNS routing or a network load balancer to route requests properly.

### Backups

There are many solutions to back up files. DRedis will have no impact when backups are performed because it's done from the outside (different from Redis, which uses `fork()` to snapshot the data).
A straightforward approach is to have period backups to an object storage such as Amazon S3.


## Why Python

Because it's a good language to get things off the ground quickly and @hltbra knows it very well.
If this becomes a valuable project, other languages will be evaluated — the language of choice won't affect much of the I/O bottleneck, though. 

Python 3 will be eventually supported, @hltbra didn't want to deal with bytes/str shinannigans when this project started as a proof-of-concept.


## Didn't you have better names?

@awgross suggested [RedisK](https://twitter.com/awgross/status/1031962830633934849). The name will only matter if this project survives, it's still an experiment.
